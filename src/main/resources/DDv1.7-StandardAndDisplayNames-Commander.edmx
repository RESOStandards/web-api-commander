          ICAT recessed light fixtures are rated both to safely come in contact with insulation and are better
          airsealed. ICAT is an acronym for Insulation Contact/AirTight. They can be installed safely with
          insulation and air sealing. These lights are different from IC (Insulation Contact) fixtures, which are
          not very airtight. They can also be identified by the wording “Washington State Approved.” Documentation
          on the installation is recommended because ICAT rating often requires multiple components be used as
          specified by the manufacturer. Substitutions of components can negate the rating. See: <ahref="http:

          Definition:  Renewable system (i.e., solar or wind) belonging to a third-party is installed on a
          customer’s property at little or no cost to the property owner. Property owner has entered an agreement
          to pay for the lease of the equipment. Structure:  Fee model is based on equipment to generate power, not
          power itself.  Transfer: If requirements are met it may be possible to transfer lease from home seller to
          buyer with the approval of the system owner. If being transferred, see Fannie Mae guidelines for more
          info: since lease is for equipment it must be included in the buyers DTI calculation.  If a buyer cannot
          or will not adopt a lease, then the seller is required to pay the remaining contract amount in full and
          the system would be removed.Real or Personal Property:  Renewable system is typically considered personal
          property.  All tax credits as well as maintenance responsibilities, etc. belong to the third-party owner.
          Some leases require the homeowner to pay the personal property tax.  Terms:  Lease should provide items
          homeowner is responsible for paying. In a solar lease model, a customer will sign a contract with an
          installer/developer and pay for the solar energy equipment over a period of years or decades. Solar
          leases can be structured so customers pay no up-front costs, some up-front costs (partially prepaid) or
          can be fully prepaid (the leasing company is then able to depreciate the equipment over time and offers a
          lower fee for pre-paid leases).  The homeowner may have the option to purchase the system during or at
          the end of the lease term (most leases are for 20-year terms) at its fair market value or terms set in
          the original lease contract. -->

          Definition:  Renewable system belonging to a third-party is installed on a customer’s property at little
          or no up-front cost to the property owner. Property owner is in an agreement to buy all the power
          generated at a fixed rate whether it is actually used or not.  This is typically lower than the local
          utility rate. Structure:  Fee model is based on power, not equipment to generate it. Transfer: A PPA may
          be transferred to a homebuyer with approval from the system owner. If a buyer will not adopt a PPA, then
          the seller is required to pay the remaining contract amount in full and the system would be removed. If
          being transferred, see Fannie Mae guidelines for more info:  portion of the purchase towards equipment
          must be included in the buyers DTI calculation.  Real or Personal Property: Renewable system is typically
          considered personal property.  All tax credits as well as maintenance responsibilities, etc. belong to
          the third-party owner. Terms: The customer agrees to purchase all energy produced by the system.  At the
          end of the PPA contract term (usually between 10-25 years), property owners can extend the contract and
          even buy the solar energy system from the developer based on terms in the contract.Additional info on

          Definition: Property-assessed clean energy (PACE) is a financing tool for property owners to fund energy
          or water efficiency or renewable energy installations. Structure: PACE is a secured loan that attaches to
          the property as a voluntary assessment on the property taxes.  To be eligible for a PACE loan, the
          building must be located in a local jurisdiction where the City or County has passed a resolution to
          participate in a PACE program. PACE financing is often a public-private partnership between a private
          finance company and a public agency.Transfer? The loan may be transferred to the new owner upon sale of
          the property with the approval of the system owner. Real or Personal Property? If seller owns and not a
          third-party, then renewable system is typically considered real property and tax credits and maintenance
          requirements, etc. belong to the property owner.  Terms:  Loan terms can vary between 5 and 30 years.
          Some programs also allow PACE to finance solar leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs). Due to the
          complexities of PACE financing, NAR and states like California have provided statements which are worth
          further consideration. NAR -  http://www.realtor.org/articles/administration-issues-pace-guidance; CAR -

          The Home Energy Score, managed by the US DOE, is a national system that allows homes to receive an energy
          efficiency rating, similar to the MPG rating available for cars. The Home Energy Score uses a 10-point
          scale to reflect how much energy a home is expected to use under standard operating conditions. Homes
          that are expected to use the least amount of energy (and are considered the most energy efficient) score
          a 10, and homes that are expected to use the most amount of energy (and are considered the least energy
          efficient) score a 1. The Home Energy Score uses a standard calculation method and takes into account the
          home's structure and envelope (walls, windows, foundation) and its heating, cooling, and hot water
          systems. Only Qualified Assessors who pass a DOE exam are allowed to provide the Home Energy Score. -->
