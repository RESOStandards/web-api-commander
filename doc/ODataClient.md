# Using the Commander as a Web API Client Library
Java or Scala developers may also use the Commander as a client library, 
which uses [Apache Olingo](#https://olingo.apache.org/doc/odata4/index.html) under the hood but adds things like OAuth2 support and data retrieval, 
validation, and serialization methods. 

To use the library, include the standalone Web API Commander Jar in your projects. 

Feel free to open issues or feature requests in the Commander GitHub project.
